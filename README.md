## ðŸŒ± I'm Learning

As I mentioned before, I'm learning Python for both professional purposes and potential personal projects, even though I intend to explore other languages in the future. Additionally, I'm dedicating time to learning C# exclusively for game development, using engines like Unity, Godot, among others. I'm also deepening my knowledge in web development, driven by professional reasons, much like I do with Python.

Currently, I'm exploring various areas within the field of computer science, and I haven't yet clearly defined which career path to pursue. Therefore, I'm broadening my knowledge in different areas, gradually discovering which one I want to embrace professionally. Even though I'm a complete beginner in the field.
